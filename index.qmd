# Introduction
Customer churn is a important challenge faced by businesses, particularly in highly competitive industries such as telecommunications. Understanding the factors that influence customer loyalty and churn is essential for improving customer retention and optimizing resource allocation. So for this project, we will focus on analyzing customer churn patterns using a dataset that includes demographic, service usage, and satisfaction information. And the Key questions we aim to address include: What demographic and service-related factors contribute most to churn? How does customer satisfaction influence retention? Are there notable geographic trends in churn behavior? By exploring these questions, our project seeks to provide insights for improving customer retention strategies and enhancing business outcomes.
