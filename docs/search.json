    "text": "1 Introduction\nCustomer churn is a important challenge faced by businesses, particularly in highly competitive industries such as telecommunications. Understanding the factors that influence customer loyalty and churn is essential for improving customer retention and optimizing resource allocation. So for this project, we will focus on analyzing customer churn patterns using a dataset that includes demographic, service usage, and satisfaction information. And the Key questions we aim to address include: What demographic and service-related factors contribute most to churn? How does customer satisfaction influence retention? Are there notable geographic trends in churn behavior? By exploring these questions, our project seeks to provide actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies and enhancing business outcomes.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThis project uses a dataset provided by IBM’s Accelerator Catalog, which tracks customer churn for a fictional telecommunications company. The dataset is a combination of multiple files that include demographic information, geographic data, service usage details, customer satisfaction scores, and churn status. These data were generated to simulate realistic business scenarios, allowing for exploratory analysis and modeling. Each file is in CSV format, and data are structured with rows representing individual customers and columns capturing various attributes. The dataset is static, meaning it does not receive updates, and its dimensions vary across files, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand rows. Potential issues include missing values in certain columns and the presence of overlapping information across files, requiring careful merging and cleaning. Data were imported into R using the read_csv() function for initial inspection and processing. The dataset is publicly available via IBM’s Accelerator Catalog, which provides detailed documentation of its structure and purpose.",
