    "text": "1 Introduction\nCustomer churn is a important challenge faced by businesses, particularly in highly competitive industries such as telecommunications. Understanding the factors that influence customer loyalty and churn is essential for improving customer retention and optimizing resource allocation. So for this project, we will focus on analyzing customer churn patterns using a dataset that includes demographic, service usage, and satisfaction information. And the Key questions we aim to address include: What demographic and service-related factors contribute most to churn? How does customer satisfaction influence retention? Are there notable geographic trends in churn behavior? By exploring these questions, our project seeks to provide insights for improving customer retention strategies and enhancing business outcomes.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThis project uses a dataset provided by IBM’s Accelerator Catalog, which tracks customer churn for a fictional telecommunications company. The dataset is a combination of multiple files that include demographic information, geographic data, service usage details, customer satisfaction scores, and churn status. These data were generated to simulate realistic business scenarios, allowing for exploratory analysis and modeling. Each file is in CSV format, and data are structured with rows representing individual customers and columns capturing various attributes. The dataset is static, meaning it does not receive updates, and its dimensions vary across files, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand rows. Potential issues include missing values in certain columns and the presence of overlapping information across files, requiring careful merging and cleaning. Data were imported into R using the read_csv() function for initial inspection and processing. The dataset is publicly available via IBM’s Accelerator Catalog, which provides detailed documentation of its structure and purpose.",

    "text": "3.3 Influences on Churn Categories\nNow, let’s introduce three important factors into discussion: Internet Type, Contract Type, and Unlimited Data (Yes or No). In hypothesis, one’s churn reason may be influenced by a company’s plan. We will create 3 stacked bar charts to see how Churn Category is influenced by those 3 factors.\n\n\nCode\n# Internet Type vs Churn\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = `Internet Type`, fill = `Churn Category`)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(title = \"Internet Type vs Churn\", x = \"Internet Type\", y = \"Proportion\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Contract Type vs Churn\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = `Contract.y`, fill = `Churn Category`)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(title = \"Contract Type vs Churn\", x = \"Contract Type\", y = \"Proportion\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Unlimited Data vs Churn\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = `Unlimited Data`, fill = `Churn Category`)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(title = \"Unlimited Data vs Churn\", x = \"Unlimited Data\", y = \"Proportion\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the 3 stacked bar charts, we can see that for most of the plans, competitor is the most category for a customer to churn. This suggests that no matter for what plans a customer is paying, they would all check other companies’ plans and switch to the other if they find it more favorable. However, there is one exception: when customers choose to have None for internet type, supporter’s or provider’s attitudes tend to be the most reason for their churn. Price also becomes a better reason than competitor. This suggests that customers who do not care about internet in their service may pay more attention to service attitude and prices.",

For the “Month-to-Month” contract, we see a wide distribution of tenure, with a peak around 10 months, indicating that many customers churn within the first year. The “One Year” contract shows a more concentrated distribution, with a peak above 40 months, suggesting customers are more likely to remain for the duration of their contract. The “Two Year” contract exhibits a bimodal distribution, with one peak around 24 months and another around 2-3 months, indicating that some customers fulfill their contract while others churn early. The different churn categories, such as “Attitude,” “Competitor,” “Dissatisfaction,” and “Price,” are represented in varying degrees across the tenure distributions, providing the telecommunications company with insights to develop targeted retention strategies based on contract length and the underlying reasons for customer churn.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = `Avg Monthly GB Download`, fill = `Churn Category`)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(~ `Unlimited Data`) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Avg Monthly GB Download vs Churn Category by Unlimited Data\",\n    x = \"Avg Monthly GB Download\",\n    y = \"Density\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph titled “Avg Monthly GB Download vs Churn Category by Unlimited Data” provides insights into the relationship between average monthly data usage and customer churn categories, based on whether the customer has an unlimited data plan or not. For customers without unlimited data, we see a wide distribution of average monthly data usage, with the churn categories “Competitor” and “Dissatisfaction” having the highest data usage, indicating that these customers may be more likely to churn due to reaching data caps or experiencing slower speeds. In contrast, for customers with unlimited data plans, the distribution of average monthly data usage is much more concentrated, and the churn categories are more evenly distributed across the data usage range, suggesting that for unlimited data customers, factors beyond data usage, such as network reliability, customer service, and perceived value, may play a more significant role in their decision to churn. This information can help the telecommunications company better understand the drivers of customer churn and develop targeted retention strategies.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = `Satisfaction Score`, fill = `Churn Category`)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(~ `Internet Type`) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Satisfaction Score vs Churn Category by Internet Type\",\n    x = \"Satisfaction Score\",\n    y = \"Density\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph titled “Satisfaction Score vs Churn Category by Internet Type” provides an insightful look into the relationship between customer satisfaction and the reasons for customer churn across different internet service types. For Cable internet customers, the satisfaction scores show a bimodal distribution, with peaks around 0.5 and 1.0. The “Fiber Optic” category exhibits the highest satisfaction scores, while the “None” category (likely representing non-churning customers) also has relatively high satisfaction. In contrast, the “Competitor” and “Dissatisfaction” categories show lower satisfaction scores, indicating that these factors play a significant role in driving churn for Cable customers. The DSL internet customers present a different pattern, with the “None” category again showing the highest satisfaction scores, peaking around 1.0. The other churn categories, such as “Attitude,” “Competitor,” and “Price,” have more varied satisfaction distributions, suggesting that for DSL customers, the reasons for churn are more complex and not solely driven by satisfaction. This information can help the telecommunications company better understand the nuances of customer satisfaction and its relationship to churn across their different internet service offerings. By analyzing these insights, the company can develop more targeted retention strategies to address the specific factors influencing customer loyalty and churn.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = `Avg Monthly GB Download`, fill = `Churn Category`)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Avg Monthly GB Download vs Churn\", x = \"Avg Monthly GB Download\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = `Monthly Charge`, fill = `Churn Category`)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Monthly Charge vs Churn\", x = \"Monthly Charge\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = `Tenure in Months`, fill = `Churn Category`)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Tenure in Months vs Churn\", x = \"Tenure in Months\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three graphs reveal interesting insights about churn behavior based on three factors: average monthly download (GB), monthly charge, and tenure in months, each categorized by churn reason.\nIn the first graph, “Avg Monthly GB Download vs Churn,” we see that users who churn for “Competitor” reasons tend to have higher average monthly data downloads, with a peak around 50 GB. “Attitude” and “Dissatisfaction” reasons appear to be associated with much lower average downloads, with densities peaking around 10 GB and below. This suggests that customers who are dissatisfied with their service or have a poor attitude toward support may not be heavy data users. “Price” and “Other” categories show an intermediate distribution, with price-sensitive customers likely using moderate data.\nThe second graph, “Monthly Charge vs Churn,” highlights a similar trend. Customers in the “Competitor” category are more likely to churn when their monthly charges are higher, with the peak density around $60-$80. This indicates that competitors offering better prices or more attractive plans are more appealing to higher-paying customers. On the other hand, those who churn due to “Dissatisfaction” or “Price” tend to have lower charges, with the “Price” category peaking around $40. The “Attitude” category shows a spread of monthly charges but leans more toward lower values, suggesting that attitude-related churn may not be heavily influenced by cost.\nLastly, in the third graph, “Tenure in Months vs Churn,” we observe that customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn for “Competitor” reasons, peaking within the first 12 months. This suggests that competitors are capturing newer customers, likely offering them more attractive deals. Meanwhile, those who churn due to “Dissatisfaction” and “Attitude” show more consistent churn densities across various tenures, peaking at around 20-30 months. This could indicate that dissatisfaction and negative attitudes build over time rather than being tied to a specific stage in the customer’s journey. “Price” and “Other” categories display lower churn densities, especially at longer tenures, indicating that these reasons may be less influential as customers continue using the service.\nIn summary, the churn patterns reveal that “Competitor” is primarily driven by higher usage, charges, and shorter tenures, while “Dissatisfaction” and “Attitude” appear to correlate with lower usage, charges, and longer customer relationships. “Price” and “Other” reasons seem to be more evenly distributed across usage and tenure, reflecting more complex and less easily categorized reasons for churn.",

The first graph, “City vs Churn,” shows the proportion of each churn category for various cities. From this graph, we can observe that “Competitor” churn is quite widespread across many cities, with proportions close to 1 in several cities. However, cities such as “La Cruz” and “Hollis” show a more varied distribution, with churn reasons like “Attitude” and “Price” taking more prominence. This indicates that while competitor-related churn dominates in many locations, other reasons such as dissatisfaction or price issues are more significant in certain areas, highlighting regional variations in the reasons behind customer churn.\nThe second graph, “State vs Churn,” is focused on the state of California. It reveals that all churn categories—“Attitude,” “Competitor,” “Dissatisfaction,” “Other,” and “Price”—are relatively evenly distributed in California, though “Competitor” churn seems the most common, followed by “Attitude.” This barplot suggests that churn in California may not be as dominated by one specific category as it is in some cities. Instead, the distribution of churn reasons here appears to be more balanced, with several factors contributing to customer churn at similar proportions.\nTogether, these graphs suggest that while competition-related churn is a dominant factor across both cities and states, regional variations exist in churn reasons. In some cities, factors such as attitude or price issues may play a more substantial role in driving churn, while in California, churn seems to be driven by a more balanced set of reasons. This insight could help businesses tailor their strategies depending on regional differences in customer behavior.",

    "text": "In this research, we have explored the factors influencing customer churn within a highly competitive telecommunications industry by analyzing a dataset containing demographic, service usage, and satisfaction information. The analysis primarily aimed to address key questions, such as how demographic and service-related factors contribute to churn, the influence of customer satisfaction on retention, and any geographical trends in churn behavior.\nOur findings show that “Competitor” churn is the most significant reason for customers leaving, with several other reasons such as “Dissatisfaction,” “Attitude,” and “Price” also contributing. Specifically, we observed that customers who churn for “Competitor” reasons are generally characterized by higher data usage, higher monthly charges, and shorter tenures. These customers are more likely to switch to competitors offering better services or pricing. The “Dissatisfaction” and “Attitude” categories, however, are associated with lower data usage and charges, and appear to correlate with longer customer relationships, suggesting that negative experiences build over time.\nGeographically, churn reasons show variation. In cities, “Competitor” churn remains dominant, but other reasons like “Attitude” and “Price” become more prominent in specific regions, such as “La Cruz” and “Hollis.” Conversely, the churn in California displays a more balanced distribution of churn reasons, with “Competitor” leading, but other factors like “Attitude” and “Dissatisfaction” also contributing substantially. This highlights the importance of regional strategies for customer retention.\nFurthermore, the research revealed that factors like internet type, contract type, and satisfaction scores play key roles in churn behavior. Customers with no internet access are more likely to churn due to attitude or price issues, while those with internet access, particularly fiber optic, are more likely to churn due to competitor-related factors. This suggests that the type of internet service, as well as contract length, significantly influences churn patterns. Customers with short-term contracts tend to churn sooner, with “Competitor” being the main reason, while those in longer-term contracts show more varied churn behaviors, indicating that contract type should be considered when designing retention strategies.\nSatisfaction also plays a crucial role in influencing churn. Across various internet types, customers with lower satisfaction scores are more likely to churn due to “Attitude” or “Dissatisfaction,” further underscoring the importance of service quality in retention efforts. Interestingly, satisfaction seems to have a less significant role for customers in certain service categories like DSL, where churn reasons are more varied and complex.\nIn conclusion, this analysis highlights that customer churn is influenced by a complex mix of factors, including service quality, pricing, customer satisfaction, and competition. By understanding these drivers, businesses can develop more targeted retention strategies tailored to specific customer segments based on usage patterns, satisfaction scores, and contract types. Additionally, geographic differences suggest that regional strategies could enhance retention efforts, making it essential for businesses to consider local factors when optimizing customer retention. This comprehensive understanding of churn behavior provides actionable insights for improving customer loyalty and ultimately enhancing business outcomes in the telecommunications industry.",
